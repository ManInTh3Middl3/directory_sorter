# Directory Sorter


## Description

This Python script allows users to scan a given directory, print the file types and the number of files associated with them, and then sort the files in the directory based on the user's selected sorting option. The script offers five different sorting options: sort by file type, sort by file size, sort by date created, sort by file name, and sort by last modified date. Once the sorting is complete, the script moves the files into appropriate subfolders in the directory and outputs a CSV file containing the sorted file names and their file types. The CSV file is stored in the same directory as the Python script.
